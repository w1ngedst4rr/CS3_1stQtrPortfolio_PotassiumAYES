  Girl, tell me what you're doing on the other side?<br>
  And so, just tell me, what you're doing with that other guy?<br>
  'Cause I ain't got patience to slow down the bass<br>
  All your girlfriends are wasted<br>
  They need it, they chase it<br>
  Face it, you want it, you crave it<br>
  Believe when I say that you'll know once you taste it<br>
  All of your friends have been here for too long<br>
  They must be waiting for you to move on<br>
  Girl, I'm not with it, I'm way too far gone<br>
  I'm not ready, eyes heavy now<br>
  Heart on your sleeve like you've never been loved<br>
  Running in circles, now look what you've done<br>
  Give you my word as you take it and run<br>
  Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now<br><br>

  Just give some time and space to realize that you<br>
  Were busy lying sleeping 'round with other guys<br>
  And what the hell were we?<br>
  Tell me we weren't just friends<br>
  This doesn't make much sense, no<br>
  But I'm not hurt, I'm tense<br>
  'Cause I'll be fine without you babe<br><br>

  All of your friends have been here for too long<br>
  They must be waiting for you to move on<br>
  Girl, I'm not with it, I'm way too far gone<br>
  I'm not ready, eyes heavy now<br>
  Heart on your sleeve like you've never been loved<br>
  Running in circles, now look what you've done<br>
  Give you my word as you take it and run<br>
  Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now<br><br>

  Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now<br>
  I'm not ready, eyes heavy now<br>
  All of your friends have been here for too long<br>
  They must be waiting for you to move on<br>
  Girl, I'm not with it I'm way too far gone<br>
  I'm not ready, eyes heavy now<br>
  Heart on your sleeve like you've never been loved<br>
  Running in circles, now look what you've done<br>
  Give you my word as you take it and run<br>
  Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now<br>
  I'm not ready, eyes heavy now<br>
  Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now<br>
  I'm not ready, eyes heavy now<br>
  Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now`);
