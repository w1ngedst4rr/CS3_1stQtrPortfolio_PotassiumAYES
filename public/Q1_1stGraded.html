Lyrics!

It's getting late
I know you probably wanna stay, uh
It's complicated, but
I'm in the mood to spill my brains to you

If you ain't busy, take a walk with me
We could get high, and you could talk to me
I ain't been doing way too good lately
I'm losing signal in the hills, I'm having difficulties

Calling on my angels
It's getting darker and I'm starting to get anxious
Nobody told me I'd be lonely when I'm famous
The only number on my phone I haven't changed yet
Calling on my an-

Calling on my angels
It's getting darker and I'm starting to get anxious
Nobody told me, boy, it's lonely when you're famous
The only number on my phone I haven't changed yet
Calling on my angels

Pleasure and pain feels the same to me
I lost my faith, but I still believe there's something
Blood in my eyes made it hard to see
I went out searching for an angel then you came to me, my darling

If you ain't busy take a walk with me
We could get high, and you could talk to me
Haven't been doing way too good lately
I'm losing signal in the hills, I'm having difficulties

Calling on my angels
It's getting darker and I'm starting to get anxious
Nobody told me I'd be lonely when I'm famous
The only number on my phone I haven't changed yet
Calling on my an-

Calling on my angels
It's getting darker and I'm starting to get anxious
Nobody told me, boy, it's lonely when you're famous
The only number on my phone I haven't changed yet
Calling on my angels

Calling on my angels
Heaven is watching from like 40 different angles, yeah
I know I should be grateful
Make conversation with the voices at the table, yeah, uh
Guess things are different to me
And if I talk, I know you'll listen to me, yeah
Haven't been doing way too good lately
I'm losing signal in the hills, I'm having difficulties

Calling on my angels
It's getting darker and I'm starting to get anxious
Nobody told me I'd be lonely when I'm famous
The only number on my phone I haven't changed yet
Calling on my an-

Calling on my angels
It's getting darker and I'm starting to get anxious
Nobody told me, boy, it's lonely when you're famous
The only number on my phone I haven't changed yet
Calling on my angels

‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs because‚Ä¶ I love you a little more than you realize.‚Äù ‚Äî Caleb (Xia Yizhou) from Love and Deepspace!
